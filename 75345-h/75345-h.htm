  <h2 class='c008'>PRELIMINARY REMARKS <br> <br> ON <br> <br> Gilding and Bronzing.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The art of gilding has been practiced from the
earliest dates. Mention of it is made in the Scriptures,
and it was known to the Egyptians, who made
an extensive use of it in the ornamentation of their
burial cases. It became to be generally used amongst
the Romans soon after the downfall of Carthage, and
was applied very profusely to the decoration of their
dwellings and temples.</p>

<p class='c010'>During the middle ages, and when the seats of
learning and civilization were located in Italy and
among the Moorish Arabs in Spain, the most elaborate
use of it was made in almost every branch of
art. It entered largely into architectural decoration,
and the cathedrals and mosques were favorite objects
for its display.</p>

<p class='c010'>Among the Chinese, the use of gold leaf as a
method of decoration has been practiced for an indefinite
period, and its origin with them must be very
ancient. Taken altogether, gilding is an art that has
been and still is in more general use than any other;
and the reason is, that it is almost always appropriate
wherever called into requisition.</p>

<p class='c010'>The art of gilding and of bronzing can readily be
acquired by any one who is disposed to devote care
and attention to it. It is an art having few, if any,
amateurs. Those who practice it are generally those
who follow it as a trade, and, perhaps, for the reason
that such persons have but little time to spare from
their profession, there is so little written information
found on the subject.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cyclopædias are exceedingly deficient in everything
like a correct or reliable description of the art.
The information which they give is mostly of an elementary
character, and of a kind that is somewhat
impracticable and very unavailable.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the want of a reliable work on the subject
that suggested to me the publication of such a general
exposition of the whole matter as would prove useful
to those who might desire to be informed on it. I do
not propose to do more than give a description of the
various processes, and to endeavor to make such a
description as simple and lucid as possible. It is no
part of a gilders business to make the frame which
he has to gild. Such used to be the case, but now
there are factories where the frame is turned out
completely made. There are a number of such factories
in New York, and the person requiring a frame
has only to select the desired pattern and have it
made up according to the dimensions of the picture
to be framed. Neither do I think it necessary to introduce
the subject of preparing those materials which
are made expressly for the purpose by regular dealers,
and which, of course, will then be found more reliable
than when made by inexperienced hands. There
are several respectable dealers in New York who keep
for sale almost everything connected with the gilding
and bronzing processes.</p>

<p class='c010'>At a time when every one is more or less interested
in the subject of decorative art, and when many are
seeking to qualify themselves towards proficiency in
some one or other branch of it, perhaps no more appropriate
subject could be offered to the public than
that of gilding a picture-frame in all its parts.</p>

<p class='c010'>No fine picture should be without a fine frame, and
even with a fine frame an indifferent picture is very
much improved; but taste and discernment are both
required in the selection of such a frame as either a
fine or an indifferent picture may require; and, although
the artist in general is supposed to be the
best qualified to determine as to the manner in which
his painting should be framed, the frame-maker is
really more competent for that duty, and for the best
of all reasons—that it is his specialty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Frames gilded in different colors of gold leaf are
frequently seen, and, for some subjects, such frames
may do very well; but, in general, the deep-colored
gold is the most appropriate, and is the better suited
to remain in favor with the public. There can hardly
be anything richer than a frame finished in burnished
and matted gold of a deep shade of color.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bronze frames, which have recently come so much
into vogue, are destined to retain their hold upon the
public esteem for a long time. They are a separate
style of decoration, one that is very rich, and which
admits of great variety in the preparation, and they
are particularly appropriate to many subjects, such
as water colors and engravings.</p>

<p class='c010'>The art of their preparation is comparatively new
to this country, although it has been practiced for a
long time in Europe; where, perhaps, the best work is
yet done. It has hitherto been kept a profound secret
by its votaries, and it has been a very difficult proceeding
for an amateur to obtain the least insight into
it. It is said that some bronzers, when practicing the
art, shut themselves apart, in order to prevent their
operations being watched. There is really no reason
for so much secrecy on the part of those who have
become possessed of the information concerning this
process, for the process is, in fact, a very simple one.
It does not require anything like the manipulation
which gilding requires. It is rather more laborious,
however, as the amount of burnishing of which it is
susceptible is almost unlimited. This, however, is
not labor lost, as it serves to enhance the attractiveness
of the frame when finished.</p>

<p class='c010'>It is the practice to use different colored bronze
powders in combination, and these combinations are
very rich in their effect. The silver, copper and verde-antique
make rich contrasts. There is a great field
for the exercise of taste in the bronzing process, and
those who are adepts in it can command high prices
for their work. The only drawback, and it is equally
a drawback to many other excellent processes, is, that
its popularity has been the means of causing a vast
deal of cheap and inferior work to be brought before
the public; but work that is really fine will continue
to be regarded with favor wherever it may be found.</p>

  <h2 class='c008'>THE GILDING PROCESS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>I.</h3>

<p class='c012'>I will now proceed to give a list and description of
the various implements and materials which are required
in the process of gilding picture frames.</p>

<p class='c010'>1.—<span class='sc'>A Gilding Cushion</span>, on which to lay the leaves
of gold preparatory to cutting them into the sizes
required for laying. This may be procured already
made. It is made of a board one-half inch thick and
nine and one-half inches long by five and one-half
inches wide, covered with buckskin and padded with
several thicknesses of Canton flannel. It usually has
a shield of parchment, about four inches high, on one
end, to protect the leaves from currents of air. Underneath,
is a loop for the thumb, which is to be inserted
in it when the cushion is to be held in the hand.
There is also another loop to hold the gilding knife
when not in use.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—<span class='sc'>A Gilding Knife</span>, for cutting the gold leaf. It
should be double-edged and have a tolerably keen
edge; not so much so as to cut the cushion, but sufficiently
so to divide the leaf without tearing it.
When it becomes dull it may be readily sharpened by
rubbing the edges with a piece of very fine sand paper.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—<span class='sc'>Brushes</span>, both bristle and camel’s hair. Numbers
4 and 5, of the bristle brushes, flat, are the sizes
mostly required, either for applying the white coat or
the oil-size. For the camel’s hair brushes, numbers
4, 5 and 6 are very useful, as well as a number 6 or 8
lettering pencil (brush); also several fitch blenders,
numbers 9 and 10 are good sizes; procure one of each.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—<span class='sc'>Burnishers.</span> These must be of several shapes
and sizes. Every gilder will become accustomed to
some particular shape and size, and practice only will
determine the most desirable one; but for ordinary
use, the following <i>shapes</i> and <i>sizes</i> will be found sufficient
for almost any work:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_10_pp.png' alt='Three burnishers of differing thickness and shape, particularly the tapering of the tip' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The burnishers should be made of flint, though agate
is frequently used, particularly for burnishing silver
leaf. They should be securely fastened in wooden
handles by means of brass ferrules. These handles,
as well as the stones, frequently become loosened from
continual use and require refastening. This is done
by renewing the filling with gum shellac or powdered
rosin, and applying sufficient heat to set the stones.
On cooling, they will be found to be again firm in
their sockets. The same method may be pursued with
regard to the handle. A little brick-dust mixed with
the rosin gives a more secure hold.</p>

<p class='c010'>Burnishers, contrary to the general opinion of those
who manufacture and sell them, should not be too
highly polished, but the surface should be rather dull,
as in this condition they take a better hold on the
gold. If they have too much polish, they glide over
the leaf without burnishing it. The polish may be
subdued or removed by rubbing the burnishers with
crocus martis and oil spread upon a chamois-skin.
Care must, of course, be exercised in the operation,
or too much of the polish will be removed and the
burnisher will require to be repolished. It is, perhaps,
needless to say that the burnishers should be
kept scrupulously clean and free from everything like
moisture and grease.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—<span class='sc'>Tips.</span> These are made of both camel’s hair and
badger hair. They are used to lift the gold leaf from
the cushion, after it has been suitably cut, and to apply
it to the surface prepared to receive it. When they do
not freely take up the leaf, it is customary to pass them
across the hair of the head, when they receive sufficient
electricity from it to attach the gold at once to
them. This attraction has been attributed to the
moisture which the tips receive from the hair, but I
think the notion is a mistaken one. The tips evidently
become electrified, for they will, in that condition,
attract the gold at some distance off. Moisture
would not produce this effect. The camel’s hair tips
are the best to use. Several of them will be required.
It is a good plan to cut an old one down to
within an inch and a half of the paste-board handle,
and so use it, when very narrow slips of the leaf are
being used; they can be lifted better and more safely
with such a contrivance. In all cases, the tip should
not be applied to more of the gold to be raised by it
than is actually necessary for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—<span class='sc'>Some Glue</span>, of the best white quality. Many
gilders use gelatine instead of glue. For mixing
with the burnish-size, the gelatine is undoubtedly the
more desirable. The glue should be naturally white,
not artificially so-colored; and it should be free from
all grit and sediment. Cooper’s make, of both glue
and gelatine, is undoubtedly the best, for all purposes
of gilding. It acts more uniformly and is altogether
the most reliable.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—<span class='sc'>Pipe Clay</span>, for coating the composition parts
of the frame. It usually comes in lumps and must
be allowed to soak before mixing. The pipe clay has
superseded the use of whiting for the two primary
white coats to a frame. It is free from all grit, whilst
whiting is not, and it gives a soft, smooth surface for
the layer of gold leaf.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—<span class='sc'>Paris White</span>, or whiting. This is used for
stopping up holes and other imperfections in the
frame. It has more body than the pipe clay, and for
that reason is used instead of it. Paris white is simply
whiting precipitated in powder, and it is consequently
freer from grit and other impurities.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—<span class='sc'>Oil-size.</span> This is used for giving the adhesive
coat to which the gold is applied when laid in oil.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—<span class='sc'>Burnish-size.</span> Used for giving the coat to
which the gold is applied when a burnished surface
is required.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—<span class='sc'>Cotton batting</span>, of a good quality. This is
used for pressing down the gold leaf when it is being
laid in oil.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—<span class='sc'>Gold Leaf</span>, of the best quality of deep-colored
gold. The leaf comes done up in books of twenty-five
leaves each, and made into packs of twenty books
each.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—<span class='sc'>An Ox-Gall</span>, strained into a bottle, with about
two teaspoonfuls of carbolic acid to preserve it from
decomposition. This, mixed with the white coat and
the clear size, will prevent pin-holes and frothing.
Some gilders use alcohol and even spirits of turpentine
for this purpose; vinegar has also been recommended,
but, after a thorough trial of all of them, I
feel confident that the best results will be had with
the ox-gall.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—<span class='sc'>Carbolic Acid.</span> The crystallized form is the
best to use. It comes in bottles of a pound weight.
It must be melted by placing the bottle in hot water;
and, when the fluid condition takes place, add some
water, when the whole mass will remain fluid. This
is a perfect antiseptic and very useful to mix with the
glue and gelatine, which are thereby preserved from
decomposition.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—<span class='sc'>Sand Paper</span>; numbers 0, ½ and 1.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—<span class='sc'>Alcohol</span>, of the highest proof. This is used
in laying the gold leaf which is to be burnished.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—<span class='sc'>Japan</span> gold size.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—<span class='sc'>Shellac Varnish</span>, both the brown and the
white.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—<span class='sc'>Burnish-size Strainer.</span></p>

<p class='c010'>20.—<span class='sc'>Several Cups</span>, for mixing the different preparations.
It is well to have covers for them, as all
the preparations should be effectually protected from
dust.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—<span class='sc'>A Graduated Glass Measure</span>; one of four
ounces capacity is the most useful.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—<span class='sc'>Spoons</span>, for mixing with. The tea size is the
best for general use.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>II.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The burnish-size should be always kept in a china
or earthenware jar. If kept in a tin vessel, its moisture
causes the tin to rust, and the deposit caused by
the rust is highly injurious to the size. The oil-size
may be kept in a tin vessel provided with a cover.
When this size is required for use, it should be thoroughly
stirred up, as the coloring matter of which it is in
part composed, being the heaviest, has a tendency to
settle and to leave the pure oil on the surface. Take
out only a sufficient quantity for immediate use, as it
sets quite rapidly, particularly in warm weather; and
do not return any that may be left, back to the original
vessel containing the size. Pay no attention to
the skin which from time to time forms on the surface,
when not in use.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>III.</h3>

<p class='c012'>We will now proceed in earnest to the serious work
of gilding a picture frame.</p>

<p class='c010'>1.—Commence by weighing out one ounce and a
half of glue or gelatine. Put this into a cup and
pour over it eight ounces of water by measurement.
This of course you will do with the aid of your graduated
glass measure. Let the glue soak for several
hours, and then set the cup in a pan of water and expose
it to heat until the glue becomes perfectly fluid
and completely melted. A teaspoonful of carbolic
acid must now be stirred into it and thoroughly incorporated
with it. The acid will preserve it, as already
stated, from decomposition, and most effectually so
and for any length of time. This glue should be
strained before being used. Whenever a portion of
it will be required for the preparations herein described,
it is well to take out as much only as may be
wanted for use, leaving the balance untouched; as by
so doing its purity can be relied upon, and besides,
the oftener glue is melted the weaker it becomes.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Lay down the frame which is to be gilded, back
up, and, with a pencil, mark a line across the sections,
if there be any, so as to be enabled to return them to
their correct positions when ready to do so. Next,
draw out the nails which fasten the sections together,
and then take them apart. Now turn the sections
face up and proceed to fill up any nail-holes about the
corners, where the sides have been joined together, as
well as all imperfections which may be found to exist.
There are often fractures and indentations to be
found, and these must be carefully repaired and the
frame, or its several parts, made as perfect as can be.
The joining at the corner must be filled up and made
to appear solid.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—The preparation with which all this is to be
done is made as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>Mix some of the Paris white with just sufficient
water to moisten it thoroughly, and then add enough
of the glue which has been described, and which has
been melted for the purpose, to make the mixture
into a thick paste. The Paris white might be mixed
at once with the glue, but it does not seem to combine
so well as when it has been previously moistened with
water. It will be too lumpy and full of undissolved
particles, unless mixed with the fingers; which operation
would be generally objectionable. The paste
should be just thick enough not to run.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—Now proceed to fill up the nail-holes, corner
joints and all other visible imperfections with this
mixture; either by applying it with a small bristle
brush and laying on a sufficient quantity, until the
required places are fully stopped up, and, when perfectly
dry, sand-papering them down smooth and uniform,
or by applying it like putty, with the fingers.
The latter method is not recommended, as it requires
a peculiar facility in the management, which can only
be acquired by considerable practice, and besides, it
does not give as good results.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—After smoothing down the fillings-up, the flats
and hollows of the frame should be gone over first
with number 0 sand-paper, and afterwards with a
moistened rag, and be rubbed perfectly smooth and
even and until the surface appears polished.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—The frame will now be ready for the white
coat, which must be prepared in the following manner
and then applied to the composition parts only:</p>

<p class='c010'>Soak some of the pipe clay in water, barely enough
of the latter to moisten the clay thoroughly, and then
add enough of the glue, already prepared and in so
hot a state as to render it of the consistency of thin
cream; and add also a teaspoonful of the ox-gall, to
prevent pin-holes forming and to keep it from frothing.
A little practice will be required to determine
invariably the requisite consistency, but the above
directions will give a satisfactory result. The object
of these two preliminary white coats is to kill any
grease which may still adhere to the moulding, and
which would otherwise prevent the proper drying of
the oil-size. They also serve to give a soft and
smooth appearance to these parts. The mixture as
described must be applied warm, with a bristle brush
(number 4 will do for the purpose), to all the composition
parts of the frame. Apply this mixture sparingly,
but sufficiently to cover the parts completely,
and be careful to avoid bubbles while applying it.
When the first coat is perfectly dry, apply the second.</p>

<p class='c010'>7.—When the last white coat is perfectly dry, two
coats of clear size should be applied all over these
portions which are to receive a coat of oil-size. Even
where a portion of the composition is to be burnished,
(which process is done in water,) it is better to go all
over these parts with the clear size; but the hollows
and flats which should be burnished must not be
touched, if it be possible to avoid doing so.</p>

<p class='c010'>8.—The clear size is prepared as follows: Take one
part of the melted glue, as already prepared, and mix
it with two parts of water, adding a little of the ox-gall
for the purpose already mentioned, and apply this
mixture hot, when required, using a bristle brush for
the purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>9.—The next step will be to prepare, for the purpose,
those portions of the frame which require to be burnished.
They must be coated with from three to four
coats of burnish-size. Those portions of the composition
work which are to be burnished should have one
or two preliminary coats of Paris white, applied rather
thicker than the white coats of pipe clay; and these
coats of Paris white are prepared in the same manner
as are those of pipe clay. These coats, of course, must
only be applied after the portions of the moulding
which are to be burnished have been filled up and
smoothed down. The filling up is done with thick
whiting, and the smoothing down is to be done with
a wet rag.</p>

<p class='c010'>10.—Many gilders use, as a primary coating for the
burnish-size, a preparation which is called <i>yellow clay</i>.
This yellow clay is supplied by dealers, and is to be
mixed in just the same way that the burnish-size is.
It gives a more elastic bed for the burnishing process;
but the same result may be had by giving an extra coat
or two of the burnish-size. I do not recommend its
use, particularly for beginners. It only serves to complicate
a process that is already complicated enough.</p>

<p class='c010'>11.—The burnish-size, as it is supplied by the dealers,
is not in a condition to be at once used, but must
be prepared for that purpose in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c010'>Take some of the crude burnish-size and mix it in
a cup with water, add but little water at a time, and
mix thoroughly, until the mixture barely drips from
the spoon with which it is being mixed. Now add a
teaspoonful or two of the hot glue already prepared.
On stirring this up, the mass becomes very thick.
Continue to add cautiously more glue until the whole
begins to thin down, which it will do almost immediately.
Perfect success in the burnish work depends
almost entirely upon the proper mixing of the burnish-size.
The various stages of the process must be
invariably observed, just as they have been here described.
If the operator exercises ordinary care only,
he will rarely make a failure; though sometimes failure
will occur, in spite of all precaution.</p>

<p class='c010'>This lot of burnish-size may be treated also as a
stock to be used from as required. Owing to the carbolic
acid which has been mixed with the glue, it will
keep from decomposition an indefinite length of time.
Without that antiseptic quality imparted to it, it would
spoil in a few days.</p>

<p class='c010'>As now mixed, it will be found rather hard for the
final coat or two, and it must be thinned down with
thinner glue, or simply with water, for these coats;
but for the first two coats it will be about right, and
it must be made thin enough to lay smoothly and
evenly on the flats and hollows without clogging the
brush. When applied to the ornamental parts, it may
be applied thicker. This burnish-size must be strained
through the strainer. These strainers are procured
from the dealers in gilding materials. Of course, the
size will not run through the strainer, but it must be
worked through by means of a bristle brush. It may
as well be said here that all preparations should be
strained, so as to avoid any particles of sediment which
may be in the materials.</p>

<p class='c010'>12.—Two or three coats of this prepared burnish-size
must now be applied to those parts which are to
be burnished, using a round camel’s hair brush for the
purpose. These coats must be laid on very smoothly
and uniformly. The first coat will go on rather
crudely, owing to the absorption of the size by the
under surface; but the succeeding coats go on more
freely. The size should be applied warm, not hot,
and the brush used for the purpose should be stirred
up frequently, so as to separate the hairs and allow it
to work freely. The surplus quantity must be removed
from the brush by drawing it across the sides
of the cup. The two final coats should be applied in
the same manner, but the size used must not be so
strong with glue.</p>

<p class='c010'>When the final coat is dry, it will then be ready for
the application of the gold leaf.</p>

<p class='c010'>13.—The burnishing of a frame is generally done
before the oil gilding. The application of the gold
leaf is made in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c010'>With the graduated glass measure, mix one part of
alcohol with three parts of water. This solution,
which is called <i>gin-water</i>, is the medium by which the
gold leaf is applied and affixed to those parts which
have been coated with the burnish-size. Lay the
frame in a convenient position to work upon it, and
have the gilding cushion, the knife, the tips and the
gold leaf conveniently placed for use. The customary
way of proceeding is to blow from the book on to the
cushion as many leaves as it may be convenient to use.
Some expertness is required to perform this operation
successfully, and I believe that the time required to
obtain this expertness is employed to better advantage
in removing from the book, with the aid of the knife,
a leaf at a time, when it is required to cut one into a
number of pieces; or to cut the leaf as it lays in the
book, either with the thumb-nail or with the knife.
Of course, this will be a matter of choice with the
gilder, as to how he will proceed; and he will be altogether
governed by the greater facility with which he
can work with either method. When the leaf has
been cut into the required size for use, lift, by means
of the tip, first drawn across the hair of the head, a
piece of the gold leaf, and, after wetting thoroughly
with the gin-water the portion where it is to be laid,
using a camel’s hair brush for the purpose, apply the
gold quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>There seems to be in the gold an occult attraction
towards the gin-water; for the leaf is at once drawn
to it, and care must be exercised to have the leaf applied
at once as nearly right as possible, for where it
goes, there it must remain. It must not be touched
until dry; although a cyclopædia informs us that the
leaf must be pressed down with a camel’s hair brush.
Such a proceeding would result in anything but a
nice state of affairs, as any one will find who might
make the experiment.</p>

<p class='c010'>14.—Never retouch the gold until dry. If the leaf
cracks on going on, which it will do in inexperienced
hands; do not mind it, but proceed to lay the gold
where required. On moistening with the gin-water,
be careful not to touch gold already laid, but wet
close up to and adjoining it, and let the next piece of
leaf lay or lap a little over the first. The moisture
runs from the one into the other and makes the junction,
when dry, complete.</p>

<p class='c010'>15.—When the lay is completed and dry, proceed to
patch up any cracks and imperfections. This is done
by using the number 6 or 8 lettering pencil, and with
its long and flexible point, filled with sufficient of the
gin-water, wetting the cracks and imperfections one
by one and applying pieces of the gold leaf of the required
sizes to cover them up completely.</p>

<p class='c010'>These pieces at once adhere to and join the lay
perfectly, and, when they come to be burnished over,
never show in the least where they have been applied,
unless the burnish-size is too harsh and hard. In
this case, the double layer of gold is brought out.</p>

<p class='c010'>16.—In about an hour or so, for the flats and hollows,
and rather longer for those places where the moisture
settles and collects, and consequently remains longer,
the lay will be ready to be burnished. The burnisher
should be held at an angle, not too perpendicularly,
and applied to the gold, finishing as you go along,
and burnishing only a small piece at a time. Burnish
right over the leaf, just as it has been laid, without
brushing off the loose gold leaf.</p>

<p class='c010'>17.—Burnish over the loose and the firm gold together.
Sometimes, and most generally, there will be
imperfections in the burnishing when first completed.
These may arise from imperfect adhesion of the leaf,
or from the leaf rubbing off when the burnish-size has
been made too strong with glue, and so the surface has
become harsh and hard. These imperfect places may
be repaired by simply rubbing them with a wet rag to
remove any leaf still adhering, and, when dry, going
over them with a thin coat or two of burnish-size and
relaying them with gold; but using the least moisture
possible, or otherwise a stain will appear around the
edges where the moisture has settled. Of course, such
places must be reburnished. No moisture should ever
be allowed to get on the leaf where another piece of gold
leaf is not at once affixed, as otherwise a stain will be
made which will mar the uniform purity of the burnish.</p>

<p class='c010'>18.—Sometimes the surface will chip under the burnisher,
particularly about an edge or corner, when too
much pressure is applied. This may arise from several
causes, but most generally does from the fact that
the first and second coats of size have not been of the
proper strength, and consequently have a tendency to
crumble when the burnisher is applied with more than
ordinary force.</p>

<p class='c010'>19.—In very warm weather, gilders are in the habit
of putting a piece of ice in the gin-water. The object
of this is not particularly clear. It is claimed for it,
however, that it causes the gin-water to lay better
on the surface of the burnish-size.</p>

<p class='c010'>If a chip should occur in a prominent flat, there is
no remedy but to wash off the gold leaf with a wet
rag, and down to the hard finish, and to re-do the
side entirely over. When not too prominent, fill up
the chipped place with Paris white, and when dry,
scrape smooth with a penknife, and after giving two
or three coats of burnish-size, re-lay the gold and reburnish.</p>

<p class='c010'>Be careful, when burnishing edges and corners, to
bear as lightly as possible with the burnisher, in order
to avoid chipping.</p>

<p class='c010'>20.—Marks in the burnish sometimes appear which
seem to be stains, and which branch off in many
ways. Such defects are most probably caused by the
gin-water being too strong.</p>

<p class='c010'>21.—The next step will be to apply the oil gold-size
to these parts which have been left bare of gold and
which have been thoroughly sized with the clear
size. It is customary to previously go over with
clear size these places which have been touched with
burnish-size and which have not received any coating
of gold; otherwise the oil-size would be absorbed and
would leave no tacky surface to which the gold leaf
would adhere. Sufficient of the gold-size should be
taken from the can containing it, after first stirring
the gold-size up thoroughly, so as to mix it completely
with the oil which generally settles on top of it. A
piece of tin or glass is the best thing to work from,
and the bristle brush with which the size is to be
applied should be well rubbed on it from time to
time, to distribute the size thoroughly through the
brush.</p>

<p class='c010'>  The size must be applied thoroughly to the frame,
not too freely, so as to run and settle in hollows, but
just enough to cover the surface with a complete coating.
Be particular to work the size into all corners
and crevices. The brush should not at any time be
overcharged with the size. If the size is not evenly
distributed over the frame, those places where it
settles will simply coat over with a film, leaving the
size underneath still fluid, and when the gold comes
to be rubbed in with the blender, the film will quickly
rub off, and the gold leaf will consequently not adhere.</p>

<p class='c010'>If any of the oil-size has got upon the burnished
parts, which in spite of all care will occur at times, it
must be rubbed off with a chamois-skin and if such
places are still dingy after the oil gilding, they will
admit of considerable polishing with the chamois.</p>

<p class='c010'>22.—The coat of oil-size must now be allowed to dry.
The time required for this purpose depends altogether
upon the drying quality of the size. It is generally
made to dry in about ten hours and to retain its tacky
surface for several days. It is well to allow it to
stand for, at least, from twenty to twenty-four hours;
particularly in the winter time, as the more thoroughly
dry it is, the brighter will the gilding appear when
completed.</p>

<p class='c010'>When this coating of oil-size has dried sufficiently,
it will be ready to have the leaf applied. The leaf, as
it is applied, is pressed down gently with a pad of
cotton batting. When the frame has been completely
covered, take a soft fitch blender and with it distribute
the gold thoroughly into corners and depressions.
Be careful not to rub too hard, or the gold will be
either rubbed off or assume a greasy appearance.
If this be all properly done, the gold will have
almost as bright and polished an appearance as if it
had been burnished.</p>

<p class='c010'>23.—After dusting the frame well, to remove as
much of the dust and particles of leaf as possible,
proceed to give these portions only of the frame which
have been gilded in oil a coat of finishing-size, which
is prepared in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c010'>Take one part of the melted gelatine or glue, as already
prepared, and add to it four parts of water. Now,
with a camel’s hair brush, apply this finishing size, hot,
or nearly so, very sparingly, but very thoroughly. This
finishing size may be colored, if desired, so as to deepen
the shade of gold; using for that purpose, dragon’s
blood, gum gamboge or aniline yellow. Only one
coat of this size should be applied. This finishing-size
serves to give a uniform appearance to the gold,
slightly matting the metallic lustre of it, and having
the effect also to absorb and remove the loose gold
dust and particles still remaining. It also protects
the surface from becoming dingy from smoke or other
impurities which frequently prevail in rooms.</p>

<p class='c010'>24.—If it should be desired to render the appearance
of the gold still duller or more matted, a very
thin coat of the ormolu, which is hereinafter described,
should be applied instead of the finishing-size. The
more matted the appearance of the surrounding gold,
the brighter and more lustrous will be the burnished
part. This is altogether a matter of taste and fashion,
sometimes a preference for one effect and sometimes
for another, prevailing with the public.</p>

<p class='c010'>25.—Before the application of the finishing size, any
imperfectly covered places must be regilded, using for
a size the Japan gold size. This size sets in about an
hour, and for that reason is preferable to the ordinary
oil-size. The places to be regilt should be first gone
over with shellac varnish. Whenever gold is to be
regilt, it must be gone over with shellac, as otherwise
it will have a greasy appearance.</p>

<p class='c010'>26.—Old frames that are to be regilt, should be first
washed clean and free from dirt, and then be given a
coat of shellac before the oil-size is applied. Where
any burnish has been, it must, of course, be washed
off before the reburnishing can be done.</p>

<p class='c010'>Some gilders use shellac varnish in place of the
clear size, to size the frame for the oil gilding. It
works well enough on the composition parts, but on
the flats and hollows it dries so rapidly that it leaves
ridges and inequalities to such an extent that the
smoothness of the work is spoiled. For quick work,
however, and by using the shellac very sparingly and
giving two coats of it, very good results are to be
had.</p>

<p class='c010'>27.—Flats are generally matted. Occupying, as they
do, a prominent and conspicuous position, being next
to the picture which is to occupy the frame, they require
to be very perfectly done, and they are therefore
done in <i>water-gilt</i>, and subsequently matted with a coat
and sometimes with two of ormolu. The flat to be
matted is proceeded with as follows:</p>

<p class='c010'>After all imperfections have been removed, it must
be rubbed smooth with very fine sand paper and polished
with a moist rag. Three coats of burnish-size
are then applied very evenly and smoothly to it, avoiding
all marks of the brush where possible; or two coats
of yellow clay, prepared in the same manner as the
burnish-size, and afterwards two coats of burnish-size,
are given. When the final coat is sufficiently dry, the
flat must be polished with a piece of coarse paper, or
it may even be burnished, when time is no object. If
the inside edge should be intended to be burnished
after being laid in gold, that part must not be polished,
nor receive the coat of very thin glue water,
which is to be applied after the polishing process to all
that part which is to be matted. This coat of glue
water must be applied very evenly and freely to the
flat, avoiding bubbles if possible. When dry, the flat
is all laid in gold in the same manner as proceeded
with when laying the gold for the burnish work.</p>

<p class='c010'>28.—The best plan to lay a perfect flat is to double-gild
it, which consists in simply laying on another
coat of gold after the first has dried. The first coat
when dry, as well as the second, must be rubbed
smooth with a wad of cotton batting. Care must be
exercised during this process, in order to avoid, as
much as possible, disturbing the lay. To lay a second
coat over the first, the gin-water must be washed
over at once, so as to avoid washing up the gold
leaf.</p>

<p class='c010'>29.—After the gold has been rubbed smooth with the
cotton, a coat of ormolu must be applied to the unburnished
part, to impart to it the matted appearance
required. The ormolu should be applied warm and
by means of a camel’s hair brush, and the application
must be very nicely and carefully done.</p>

<p class='c010'>30.—The following is the manner in which the
ormolu is prepared:</p>

<p class='c010'>Take a teaspoonful of either the tincture of gum benzoin
or of white shellac varnish, and mix it in a cup
with about twice or three times its bulk of the highest
proof alcohol. Now have ready a hot solution of glue
or of gelatine, of about the same strength as that of
the finishing size. The quantity should be about one-half
a teacupful. This must be poured quickly and
all at once into the solution of the gum benzoin or of
shellac, and the result will be a perfect emulsion of
the gum, which will be of a milky white appearance.
This, of course, should be strained, and is to be applied
as already described. If the first coat should
appear spotty and streaky, a second one will be necessary.
In applying either the finishing size or the
ormolu, it is well to have a lump of alum convenient,
to which, from time to time, the brush may be applied.
This will, in the case of either, cause it to go
on in a better manner and to lay more evenly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ormolu, as prepared by the above method, will
keep for any length of time. It may also be slightly
colored, if it be desired to give the gold a deeper
tinge.</p>

<p class='c010'>31.—The frame will now be about finished, as far as
the gilding is concerned. The sections must now be
returned to their respective places and securely nailed
together.</p>

<p class='c010'>The outside edge of the frame, if it has been burnished,
will require no further preparation, but if it has
been gilded in oil, or if it has simply been laid in
water, it should have a coat of white spirit varnish
applied with a camel’s hair brush. This coating of
varnish will render the layer of leaf sufficiently hard
to be handled without injury to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>32.—When the edge has not been gilded at all, it is
the practice to give it two coats of yellow ochre,
mixed about as strong as those of the pipe clay and
applied with a bristle brush. The yellow ochre
should be strained before being applied.</p>

<p class='c010'>33.—Before anything has been done to the frame,
and after the sections have been taken apart, it is well
to protect the outside corners with pieces of wood
securely fastened to the back. This will prevent
them from being injured while being gilded. Gilders
generally suspend a frame when not being worked
upon, to some projection, to keep it out of the way of
injury; but, with the corners protected, it may be
stood anywhere with safety.</p>

<p class='c010'>34.—In the foregoing description of the process
of gilding, the burnished part has been described as
being done before the oil gilding. The oil gilding
may, however, be done first and the burnishing afterwards.
This manner of proceeding is generally practiced
in Europe, but not so much in this country.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, when much burnishing is to be done,
this method is recommended. All those parts of the
frame which are to be oil gilded must be coated with
the oil gold-size; and wherever this size has got upon
places to be burnished, it must be scrupulously wiped
off. Then, after the size has set and before it has
been gilded, all these parts which are to be burnished
must be gone over with a coat or two of pipe clay, to
which has been added an extra quantity of ox-gall, in
order to cause these coats to lay perfectly over any
spots which the oil-size may have touched. Then
apply the burnish-size, as previously described.
When burnishing, be very careful not to touch with
the burnisher those parts which have been oil gilded,
and do not burnish too close to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>35.—Sanded work is used very much in combination
with composition on picture-frames. The sand, or
crushed quartz, is made to adhere by means of glue.
Such sanded work must have a very thorough coating
of Paris white before being gilded.</p>

<p class='c010'>36.—Plain wood, where the grain is to be shown
after being gilt, must be well treated with shellac before
having the size applied.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c008'>THE BRONZING PROCESS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c011'>I.</h3>

<p class='c012'>The implements and materials required for the
bronzing process are the same as those required for
gilding, with the exception of the gold leaf, the cushion
knife and tips; and with the addition of the <span class='fss'>BRONZE
POWDERS</span> of the necessary colors, and of <span class='fss'>COPAL VARNISH</span>.
These may be obtained from any dealer in
art materials; but, of course, those of the best quality
only should be used.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>II.</h3>

<p class='c012'>1.—The frame which is to be bronzed must be proceeded
with in the same manner as described in the
gilding process. That is to say, all imperfections
must be first remedied and the frame put in perfect
order.</p>

<p class='c010'>2.—Two coats of pipe clay are then to be applied to
all of the composition work, using a bristle brush for
that purpose. The pipe clay is to be prepared as already
described for the gilding process.</p>

<p class='c010'>3.—Two coats of burnish-size must next be applied
all over the frame, using a bristle brush instead of a
camel’s hair brush on the composition parts. For the
smooth parts of the frame, a camel’s hair brush may
be used, as a more even surface may be obtained in
that way. The burnish-size should be applied very
sparingly, so as not to clog up the ornamental parts
of the frame. After having given the frame two
thorough coats of the burnish-size, a third and final
coat of the same size must be applied. To this final
coat, before being applied, should be added a small
quantity of powdered lamp black. The addition of
the lamp black is not absolutely necessary, however,
as the object for which it is used is simply to give a
darker appearance to the final coat, which, in the
crevices and hollows, when the whole work receives
the varnish coat, then assumes that antique appearance.
The lamp black rather impairs the burnishing
quality of the size, though not to any serious extent.</p>

<p class='c010'>4.—After the final coat has been applied, put some
of the bronze powder which is to be used into a small
saucer. A very little bronze powder will go a great
way. In another saucer, pour a weak solution of
gelatine or of gum arabic. This must be just sufficiently
strong to hold the bronze powder on the
frame. The usual way of proceeding, in order to
apply the bronze powder, is to dip the fingers first
into the gelatine or gum arabic, and then into the
bronze powder, and proceed to rub it on to the work
to be bronzed. It may be applied with a bristle
brush, and, where the powder is to be inserted into
cracks and crevices, it must be so applied. The object
of using the fingers is, that with them a smoother
and thinner coat can be obtained; and the smoother
and thinner the coat, the better will it burnish.</p>

<p class='c010'>5.—When the frame has been completely covered
and the coating is sufficiently dry, all the flat and
smooth parts of the frame, and all those parts of the
composition work also which are in relief, must be
completely burnished. This part of the work requires
a great deal of patience and time; but one is fully
repaid for the labor bestowed, in the brilliancy of the
work when done.</p>

<p class='c010'>6.—After the frame has been burnished sufficiently,
a thin coat of copal varnish is to be given all over it.
The varnish is intended to protect the bronze from
tarnishing through contact with the air, as well as
from any moisture which might accidentally get on
the frame, and which, of course, would remove the
film of bronze.</p>
